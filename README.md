# Project Name

## Description

Provide a brief description of your project. What does it do? What technologies does it use? 

Example:  
A web application that tracks real-time AIS (Automatic Identification System) data and displays ship locations on a map.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Vue 3, TailwindCSS, Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.10
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other**: Docker, HTTP API, AIS Data API

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- Python 3.x (for backend development)

## Setup and Running the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```

### 2. Set up environment variables (if applicable)

If your project requires any environment variables (e.g., API keys or credentials), make sure they are set in the `.env` file or configured in the Docker environment.

For example:
```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017
```

### 3. Build and run the project using Docker Compose

This command will start all necessary services (frontend, backend, and MongoDB).

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build Docker images
- Start the frontend on port `42069`
- Start the backend on port `8000`
- Start MongoDB on the default port (`27017`)

### 4. Access the application

- Frontend: `http://localhost:42069`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

### 5. Stopping the project

To stop the services, use:

```bash
docker compose down
```

This will stop and remove all containers.

## Available Endpoints

### 1. **GET /api/ais-data**

- **Description**: Fetches live AIS data (ships' positions).
- **Response**: A list of ships' data (e.g., name, position, course, etc.).

**Example Request:**

```bash
GET http://localhost:8000/api/ais-data
```

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "ship_name": "Vessel 1",
    "latitude": "60.1234",
    "longitude": "5.1234",
    "course": "North"
  },
  ...
]
```

---

### 2. **POST /api/ais-update**

- **Description**: Updates AIS data in the backend.
- **Body**: JSON data with ship information.

**Example Request:**

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/ais-update
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ship_name": "Vessel 1",
  "latitude": "60.1234",
  "longitude": "5.1234",
  "course": "North"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Errors**: If you get a CORS error, ensure the backend API allows requests from your frontend's origin (CORS configuration).
- **401 Unauthorized**: Make sure you have the correct API key for accessing external services (if applicable).

This structure should cover the essential setup and usage information for your project. You can adapt the specifics to fit your project as needed.

Let me know if you need help adding any details!

1. **`database.py`**: 
This file typically handles the database connection, configuration, and session management.
 Document its database initialization, connection handling, and any utilities for interacting with MongoDB.

2. **`models.py`**: 
This defines the data models (MongoDB collections or schema) used in your application. 
Document the structure, fields, and any relationships between models.

3. **`crud.py`**: 
Contains functions that define basic Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on your models.
 Document each CRUD function, specifying what data it handles and how it interacts with the database.

4. **`routes.py`**: 
Defines the API endpoints (routes) of your application. 
Document each route, HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), request/response data, and expected outcomes.

5. **`main.py`**:
 Typically contains the FastAPI application setup, including route inclusion and middleware configuration. 
Document how the app initializes, the routes it serves, and any startup or shutdown procedures.
