### Possible Questions and Answers for the Audience Quiz:

---

#### **1. What inspired you to build this project?**

**Answer:**  
The project was inspired by the need for real-time ship tracking and data visualization. We wanted to create a solution that could fetch live data from an external API, store it efficiently in a database, and display it to users in real time. This project can be valuable for maritime industries and enthusiasts interested in tracking ships' positions.

---

#### **2. What technologies did you use in this project?**

**Answer:**  
We used:
- **Vue 3** for the frontend, to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **FastAPI** for the backend, which provides fast and easy development of RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB** for the database to store ship data and other related information.
- **Docker** for containerizing the application and ensuring it’s easy to deploy and manage.
- We also used **API keys** for secure communication with the external API and ensured all sensitive data was handled safely.

---

#### **3. Can you explain how real-time updates are handled in the application?**

**Answer:**  
We fetch real-time ship data from an external API. The backend, built using FastAPI, makes periodic requests to the API for the latest data. When new data is received, it is stored in our MongoDB database. The frontend (Vue 3) then dynamically fetches this updated data from the API and displays it in real-time to the user, ensuring they always see the latest information.

---

#### **4. Why did you choose FastAPI for the backend?**

**Answer:**  
We chose FastAPI for its high performance and ease of use. It is built on asynchronous capabilities, which helps with fast data processing, especially when handling multiple requests, like fetching live data. Additionally, FastAPI automatically generates API documentation, making it easy for us to test and use the endpoints.

---

#### **5. How does Docker help in this project?**

**Answer:**  
Docker is used to containerize each part of our application, such as the backend, frontend, and database. By containerizing the app, we ensure that the environment is consistent across all stages of development and production. Docker also allows us to easily scale our application and manage different components without worrying about dependencies or system configurations.

---

#### **6. Can you describe the database structure you used in MongoDB?**

**Answer:**  
In MongoDB, we store ship data in collections. Each collection holds documents representing individual ships with fields like their current position, heading, timestamp, and other relevant details. We use MongoDB’s flexibility to easily update and query data, which is essential for storing real-time information.

---

#### **7. How do you ensure the UI is responsive and works on different devices?**

**Answer:**  
We used **TailwindCSS** in combination with Vue 3 to ensure the UI is responsive. TailwindCSS’s utility-first classes allowed us to easily create flexible layouts that adapt to various screen sizes. Additionally, we tested the application on multiple devices to ensure that the interface is user-friendly and functional across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

---

#### **8. How do you handle user authentication in the project?**

**Answer:**  
Currently, the project does not implement user authentication. However, in future versions, we plan to add user authentication with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or integrate with third-party authentication services like **OAuth** to ensure secure access to certain features, such as user-specific data.

---

#### **9. What would you do to scale the project for more users or data?**

**Answer:**  
To scale the project, we would:
- **Optimize the database**: Use techniques like indexing to speed up data retrieval and improve performance.
- **Container orchestration**: Use **Kubernetes** to manage the containers, scale the backend, and handle high traffic.
- **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms, like **Redis**, to reduce the load on the backend and speed up response times.
- **Load balancing**: Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the backend.

---

#### **10. How do you store and secure sensitive information, like API keys?**

**Answer:**  
We use environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys. These variables are not hardcoded into the application but instead are loaded securely from `.env` files or through Docker secrets, ensuring that keys are not exposed in the code. Additionally, sensitive data is never logged or exposed in error messages.

---

#### **11. Can you explain how you handled error handling in the application?**

**Answer:**  
We ensure proper error handling in both the frontend and backend. On the frontend, we use Vue 3’s error handling mechanisms to catch any issues related to fetching data and display user-friendly error messages. On the backend, we use FastAPI’s built-in exception handling to catch errors, log them, and return appropriate error responses to the client.

---

#### **12. What are your plans for future improvements to the project?**

**Answer:**  
In the future, we plan to:
- Implement user authentication and role-based access to manage who can access and update ship data.
- Add additional data sources to enrich the ship data, such as weather information or vessel history.
- Enhance the UI with interactive maps to visualize the ships’ real-time locations.
- Scale the backend and frontend to handle higher traffic and larger datasets efficiently.
